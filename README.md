In this program, all opening brackets are stored in a vector.
Whenever a closing bracket appears, it checks if it matches the last opening bracket and removes it.
At the end, if the vector is empty, it means all brackets were closed correctly = Valid.
If the vector is not empty, some brackets are unmatched = Invalid.
